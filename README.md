# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

This project is a weather dashboard application that fetches weather data, calculates daily summaries, and checks for alerts. It uses Django with Celery for task scheduling.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Django
- Celery
- Redis (for Celery broker)

## Installation (WSL - Ubuntu)

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bhanuu01/Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring.git
    cd Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring/weather_monitoring
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application (WSL - Ubuntu):

1. **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. **Start Django Development Server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. **Install Redis:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server
    ```

    **Start the Redis service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start redis-server
    ```

4. **Start Celery Worker:** Open a new terminal window, navigate to your project directory, and run:

    ```bash
    celery -A weather_monitoring worker --loglevel=info
    ```

5. **Start Celery Beat:** In another terminal window, run:

    ```bash
    celery -A weather_monitoring beat --loglevel=info
    ```

6. Add default cities to database
   
   ```bash
    python manage.py populate_cities
    ```


## Usage

**Running Tasks:**

- **Fetch Weather Data:** Runs every 5 minutes to fetch weather data for all cities.
- **Calculate Daily Summary:** Runs daily at midnight to calculate and store the daily weather summary.
- **Check Alerts:** Runs every 10 minutes to check if any city's temperature exceeds 35Â°C.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Open a web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/) to view the weather dashboard.
Temaparature scale feature allows users to select their preferred temperature scale, as illustrated in the figure below. It then provides temperatures based on the user's selection.
